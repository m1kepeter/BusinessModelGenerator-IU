# Business Model Generator (university project)
## Introduction
In this repository I extracted my own work from the [origin repository (private)](https://github.com/MauriceN/IU-SE-Fallstudie-BMG) which our team used at university.

This is just a prototype and **not** the final version of the product!
[On this link you can get a prototype preview](https://bmg.under.stream).


## PHP local installation
To test the prototype you can click [this link](https://bmg.under.stream) or run a local PHP server on your computer. This is very easy with [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/de/download.html).
### Apple Silicon
Working with other versions than **v7.3.13** could lead to problems on Apple Silicon machines. [Click here to download v7.3.13](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Mac%20OS%20X/7.3.31/).
